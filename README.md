# Java_study_classes
Some simple Java programs. Study material


Most programs were made while studying Java as exercises, others - just out of interest on how things work.
Some classes might lack a decent documentation and execution can be further optimized, but they work as intended.
Some of them were made just as introduction to Java world, with the knowledge that had been obtained up till that time.
